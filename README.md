# üîê DevSecOps Flask Project ‚Äì Insecure App

This intentionally vulnerable **Flask application** is created for **educational purposes** in DevSecOps training.  
It contains multiple security flaws in both the application code and the Dockerfile.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** Do **not** deploy this app in production. It is meant only for learning and practicing security scanning.

--
## üéØ Learning Goals

- Identify and fix **common security flaws** in application code and Docker images  
- Practice **SAST** (Static Application Security Testing) using SonarQube  
- Run **container security scans** with Trivy  
- Learn **secrets scanning** with Gitleaks  
- Build and run a **CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions**  
- Deploy the Flask app through CI/CD pipeline  
- Set up **application monitoring** with Prometheus & Grafana  
- Understand **secure coding & containerization best practices**

---
## üö© What's Wrong (On Purpose)

- Hardcoded credentials in the Flask app  
- No input validation  
- Debug route that exposes system commands  
- Weak session key  
- Dockerfile uses **unpinned base image**  
- Container runs as **root user**  
- Missing healthcheck and cleanup steps  

---
## üß™ Tools You‚Äôll Use

- **SonarQube** ‚Äì Static code analysis (SAST)  
- **Trivy** ‚Äì Docker image scanning  
- **Gitleaks** ‚Äì Secret detection  
- **Docker** ‚Äì Build and run the app  
- **Git & GitHub** ‚Äì Version control  
- **GitHub Actions** ‚Äì CI/CD automation  
- **Prometheus & Grafana** ‚Äì Monitoring and visualization

# üìù Student Tasks ‚Äì What You Need to Do

Follow these steps to complete the project.  
(Remember: this app is intentionally insecure, your job is to improve and secure it.)

---
### 1. Repository Setup
- Fork this repository into your own GitHub account  
- Clone your fork locally  
- Explore the project files (Flask app + Dockerfile)  

```bash
# Step 1: Fork this Repo
# (click 'Fork' on GitHub and create your own copy)

# Step 2: Clone Your Fork
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/devsecops-flask-project.git
cd devsecops-flask-project

```

---
### 2. Run Locally
- Build the Docker image of the app  
- Run the container and verify it works on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)  
```bash
# Step 1: Build the Docker Image
docker build -t devsecops-flask-project .

# Step 2: Run the App
docker run -p 5000:5000 devsecops-flask-project
```
---
### 3. Analyze Security Issues
- Identify insecure practices in the Flask app  
- Identify insecure practices in the Dockerfile  
- Write down your observations before fixing  

---
### 4. Setup CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Create a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`)  
- Add the following stages in the pipeline:
  - **Checkout**: Pull code from your repo  
  - **Static Code Scan**: Run SonarQube  
  - **Secrets Scan**: Run Gitleaks  
  - **Build**: Build Docker image  
  - **Image Scan**: Run Trivy on the image  
  - **Push**: Push Docker image to a registry (GitHub Container Registry or DockerHub) (Optional)
  - **Deploy**: Run the container in your target environment  

---
### 5. Fix Security Issues (Optional)
- Apply fixes to Flask code (credentials, validation, debug routes, session key, etc.)  
- Apply fixes to Dockerfile (pin image version, non-root user, healthcheck, cleanup)  
- Commit and push changes  
- Re-run pipeline and verify scans show improvements  

---
### 6. Monitoring Setup
- Deploy **Prometheus** in a container  
- Deploy **Grafana** in a container  
- Connect Prometheus as a data source in Grafana  
- Create two dashboards: one generic monitoring dashboard for system metrics and one Docker monitoring dashboard for container metrics on the server where the application is deployed

---
### 7. Final Deliverables
- WShare the repository URL of a working Flask app deployed via CI/CD  
- Passing scans in CI/CD (SonarQube, Trivy, Gitleaks)  
- Running Prometheus + Grafana monitoring stack  
- Documentation (google doc) of:
  - Insecure issues found  
  - Fixes applied  
  - Screenshots of scans & dashboards
